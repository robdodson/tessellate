# Tessellate

Tessellate watches your project directory and writes your handlebars templates to static files on save. This is great for designing in code when you want to reuse elements across multiple pages. Tessellate is intended for folks who don't want to or are not comfortable writing a bunch of JavaScript. Instead you can follow the patterns laid out in the example to have a project of reusable elements which render to static files.

## TODO

- Handle no context file
- Tidy HTML?
- Register partials on a new .handlebars event
